Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend.", "Interested. I do love dark movies and dark humor as well. Would you mind being more specific in terms of how they portray societies role? In other words, whom do they take stabs at? LOL", "It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything.", "Ha ha ha. Fair enough. My fear with that movie was that it would turn out like Suicide Squad which had great potential but fell far short from expectations. I also stray away from comic book movies, however DC has kept me more entertained with how dark they seem to be. Would you say that this movie would be closer to Suicide Squad, or closer to the Dark Knight?", "Suicide Squad was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real.", "EXCELLENT!! you had me sold when you said Suicide squad was garbage! I accept your recommendation. I saw the Director also said to watch it as a completely independent movie as well. Is this movie friendly for the more religious side of ones family? I have a few Zealots and want to know what too expect so I can stave off their constant state of being offended lol.", "I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really. But i am biased i'm pretty agnostic so i dont watch for it much. I'd be more worried about becoming anarchist after watching it then any religious aspect.", "Noted. Well I certainly appreciate the recommendation! Any other last second recommendations? I mean you love John Wick and the Joker I was already considering but hadn't decided. So, It seems we have similar tastes.", "Hmm well as for some solid gems on Netflix, check out Tau and Ex Machina they're both sifi but on the dark side. Also as far Joaquin Phoenix goes the movie 'Her' is fantastic and will make you cry. lol", "I have heard of the movie Her. I will also watch that one. I really appreciate the recomendations. A lot of junk out there and no real guidance. Thank you and take care.", "I hope you like them. You too.", "one last thing!! What is Ex Machina about?", "About this guy who goes on a secret job at some genius's house to help him see if his AI passed the turing test.", "I was reading about it while you replied earlier an It was not very clear lol . You said sifi, futuristic I presume?"], "resp": "Yes but not to far future. Im a sucker for science fiction.
